# Welcome To The Neighborhood

## Global Game Jam Team game creation

## Getting Started
  1. Using the arrow keys, move left or right to move toward your fellow neighbors to help them with their problems and they will give you the ingredients you need to help bake your pie!
  2. Your neighboors will ask questions, if you give them the correct answer, they will help you with a portion of your pie and you will obtain a point. Answer incorrectly and you must give them a point for wasting their time.
  3. Try to get the most amount of points and finish your pie!
